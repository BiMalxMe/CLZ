        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
            The All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) was established in 1951 and joined FIFA in 1970. Since then, Nepal has participated in multiple regional and international tournaments.
            The national team, known as the "Gorkhalis," won the SAFF Championship in 1993 and continues to strive for excellence.  
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
            Nepal’s Martyr’s Memorial A-Division League is the country’s top domestic league, featuring clubs like Manang Marshyangdi Club, Tribhuvan Army Club, and Machhindra FC.  
            Players like Rohit Chand have gained international recognition by playing in foreign leagues, helping put Nepal on the global football map.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
